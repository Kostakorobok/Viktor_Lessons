Task 1: Cities
Create a dictionary named cities. Use the names of three cities as the keys of the dictionary. Create a nested dictionary for each city containing the following information:

The country where the city is located (country).
The approximate population of the city (population).
One interesting fact about the city (fact).
The keys of the nested dictionaries should be country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city along with all the stored information about it.


Task 2: Sandwiches
Create a list named sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various types of sandwiches. Create an empty list named finished_sandwiches.

Use a loop to iterate over the elements of the first list and print a message for each sandwich (e.g., "I made your tuna sandwich"). After processing each sandwich, move it from sandwich_orders to finished_sandwiches.

Once all the sandwiches have been processed, print a message listing all the sandwiches that have been made.
